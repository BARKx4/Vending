NPCs for selling and buying items for both players and administrators. Sold to players via a Vendor Contract Deed item, they can be placed in world anywhere the player has rights to build and will charge a weekly duty fee that will be maintained from the player's Banking bank account or debited from the vendor's sale holdings. Fully configurable via GUI, with support for custom skin loading from network resources.
